      <title>Implementing an Auto Scaling Group and Application Load Balancer</title>

      <description>In this AWS hands-on lab, we will integrate two powerful AWS services: Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling groups.
Specifically, we will create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances operating as web servers, and we&amp;rsquo;ll configure an Application Load Balancer to load balance between the instances inside that Auto Scaling group.
After everything is set up, we will simulate stress tests on the EC2 instances to confirm the Auto Scaling group works as expected.</description>
