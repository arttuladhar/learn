      <description>Amazon CloudFront  CloudFront is a CDN (Content Delivery Network). It makes website load faster by serving cached content Benefits of using CloudFront includes  Lower Latency Higher Transfer Speed Reduced load on Content Server  Origin is the address of where the original copies of your files reside eg. S3, EC2, ELB Distribution defines a collection of Edge locations and behaviors on how it should handle your cached content Distribution has 2 types: Web Distribution (static website content) and RTMP (streaming media) Edge Locations are local infrastructure that hosts cache of data Origin Identity Access (OAI) is used to access private S3 buckets, restricting S3 bucket access only via Cloud Front Access to cached content can by protected via Signed Urls or Signed Cookies Lambda@Edge allows you to pass each request through a Lambda to change the behavior of the response  Amazon Route 53  Route53 is a DNS provider, register and manage domains, create record sets and health check of resources Simple Routing (Default) - A simple routing policy is a single record within a hosted zone that contains one or more values.</description>
