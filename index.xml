      <description>Containers Microservices Container Orchestration  Container Orchestrators   Containers Containers are application-centric methods to deliver high-performing, scalable applications on any infrastructure of your choice. Containers are best suited to deliver microservices by providing portable, isolated virtual environments for applications to run without interference from other running applications.
Microservices Microservices are lightweight applications written in various modern programming languages, with specific dependencies, libraries and environmental requirements. To ensure that an application has everything it needs to run successfully it is packaged together with its dependencies.</description>

      <description>Multi-container pods are simply pods with more than one container that all work together as a single unit.
It is often a good idea to keep containers separate by keeping them in their own separate pods, but there are several cases where multi-container pods can be beneficial.
You can create multi-container pods by listing multiple containers in the pod definition.

      <description>Authentication Authorization  Types of RoleBindings Admission Control  Demo - Authentication and Authorization  To access and manage any Kubernetes resource or object in the cluster, we need to access a specific API endpoint on the API server. Each access request goes through the following three stages:
 Authentication - Logs in a user Authorization - Authorizes the API requests added by the logged-in user. Admission Control - Software modules that can modify or reject the requests based on some additional checks, like a pre-set Quota.</description>

      <description>Amazon Athena  Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that utilizes Schema-On-Read, allowing you to run ad-hoc SQL like queries on data from a range of sources Athena is used to query large dataset (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) stored in S3 with infrequent access pattern You are charged for compute time only. You don’t need to maintain separate dataset for Athena, it can directly access S3 bucket  Amazon EMR  EMR is tool for large-scale parallel processing of big data and other large data workloads It is based on the Apache Hadoop framework and is delivered as a managed cluster using EC2 instances It is used for huge-scale log analysis, indexing, machine learning, financial analysis, simulations, bio-informatics and many other large-scale applications EMR cluster have zero or more core nodes, which are managed by the master node.</description>

      <description>Labels, Selectors, and Annotations Deployments Rolling Updates and Rollbacks  Rolling Updates and Rollbacks  Jobs and CronJobs  Labels, Selectors, and Annotations Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects. They are used for identifying various attributes of objects which can in turn be used to select and group various subsets of those objects.
We can attach labels to objects by listing them in the metadata.labels section of an object descriptor.</description>

      <description>Services Service Object Example kube-proxy Service Discovery Servie Type  Cluster IP NodePort LoadBalancer ExternalIP ExternalName   Services  An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don’t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.</description>

      <description>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)  SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service Topics are logical access point and communication channel within SNS Topics can be encrypted via KMS Subscribers are endpoints that receive message for topic. When a topic received a message it automatically and immediately pushes messages to subscribers SNS supports notification over multiple protocols:  HTTP/HTTPS - Subscribers specify a URL as part of the subscription registration Email/Email Json - Messages are sent to registered address as email SQS - User can specify an SQS standard queue as the endpoint SMS - Messages are sent to registered phone number as SMS text messages   Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)  SQS provides fully managed, highly available message queuing service for inter-process /service /service messaging SQS is used for application integration, it lets decouple different systems SQS supports both Standard and FIFO Queues Standard queues are distributed and scalable to nearly unlimited message volume.</description>

      <description>Volumes Volume Types PersistentVolumeClaims Using a Shared hostPath Volume Type  Volumes As we know, containers running in Pods are ephemeral in nature. All data stored inside a container is deleted if the container crashes. However, the kubelet will restart it with a clean slate, which means that it will not have any of the old data.
To overcome this problem, Kubernetes uses Volumes. A Volume is essentially a directory backed by a storage medium.</description>

      <description>With Services, routing rules are associated with a given Service. They exist for as long as the Service exists, and there are many rules because there are many Services in the cluster. If we can somehow decouple the routing rules from the application and centralize the rules management, we can then update our application without worrying about its external access. This can be done using the Ingress resource.
 An Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster Services.</description>

      <description>Redux gives you a store, and lets you keep state in it, and get state out, and respond when the state changes. But that’s all it does.
It’s actually react-redux that lets you connect pieces of the state to React components.
 The state is the data, and the store is where it’s kept
 Redux Store Redux Reducer Reducer&amp;rsquo;s job is to take the current state and action and return the new state.</description>

      <description>Changing Engine for Hive Queries In general, Tez provides increased performance over Map Reduce specially where JOINS are required resulting in intermediate output being written to disk.
set hive.execution.engine=tez  Using Partitions Partitions separate date in Hive tables by HDFS directories. If data is distributed based on partitions on certain fields, Using those fields to access data allows speeding up Hive queries. In other words, querying without partitions equates to full table scan.</description>

      <description>Hive Table Storage Formats Avoid using TEXT format, Sequence file format or complex storage format such as JSON. Ideally, RCFile (Row Columnar File) or Parquet files are best suited. If you are building data warehouse on Hive, for better performance use Parquet file format.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table ( col1 int, col2 string ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY &#39;,&#39; STORED AS PARQUET;  Compression Techniques Try to split compression algorithms provided by Hadoop &amp;amp; Hive like Snappy.</description>

      <description>In this AWS hands-on lab, we will integrate two powerful AWS services: Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling groups.
Specifically, we will create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances operating as web servers, and we&amp;rsquo;ll configure an Application Load Balancer to load balance between the instances inside that Auto Scaling group.
After everything is set up, we will simulate stress tests on the EC2 instances to confirm the Auto Scaling group works as expected.</description>

      <description>Jenkins Shared library is the concept of having a common pipeline code in the version control system that can be used by any number of pipeline just by referencing it. In fact, multiple teams can use the same library for their pipelines. Pipeline has support for creating &amp;ldquo;Shared Libraries&amp;rdquo; which can be defined in external source control repositories and loaded into existing Pipelines.
 A shared library is a collection of independent Groovy scripts which you pull into your Jenkinsfile at runtime.</description>

In Java programming language, a Lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, i.e., a function with no name and without being bounded to an identifier. They are written exactly in the place where it’s needed, typically as a parameter to some other function.
The most important features of Lambda Expressions is that they execute in the context of their appearance.</description>
