Drone is a CI/CD platform built on Docker and written in Go.

## Creating Pipeline

Drone pipeline are written in `.drone.yml` file in the root of the repository.

* Pipelines are event based, which can be triggered via `push`, `pull_request`, `tag` and `deployment` events

```
pipeline:
  backend:
    image: golang
    commands:
      - go get
      - go build
      - go test

  frontend:
    image: node:6
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm test

  notify:
    image: plugins/slack
    channel: developers
    username: drone
```

### Images

Drone executes your build inside an ephemeral Docker Image, which means you don't have to setup or install any repository dependencies.

### Cloning

Drone automatically clones your repository into a local volume that is mounted into each Docker container.

### Commands

Drone mounts the workspace into your build container (Defined Image) and executes bash commands inside your build container, using the root of your repository as the working directory.

### Services

Drone supports launching service containers as part of the build process. This can be very helpful when your unit tests require database access etc.

### Plugins

Drone supports publish, deployments and notification capabilities through external plugins.

## Running Drone Locally

```
drone exec
```

## Drone Secrets

### Repo Level Secrets

```shell
# Create Value Secret (Concealed)
drone secret add --conceal <repo_path> <secretName> <secretValue>

# Create Value Secret
drone secret add <repo_path> <secretName> <secretValue>

# Create File Secret
drone secret add <repo_path> <secretName> @<filePath>

# View Secret for a Repo
drone secret ls <repo_path>
```

### Org Level Secrets

```shell
# Create Org Level Secret (Concealed)
drone org secret add --conceal <org> <secretName> <secretPass>

# Create Org Level Secret
drone org secret add <org> <secretName> <secretPass>

# Create Org Level File Secret
drone org secret add <org> <secretName> @<filePath>
```

### Using Secrets in Pipeline

```yaml
pipeline:
  docker:
    image: plugins/docker
-   username: ${DOCKER_USERNAME}
-   password: ${DOCKER_PASSWORD}
+   secrets: [ docker_username, docker_password ]
```
