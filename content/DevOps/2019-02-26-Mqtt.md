## Introduction

- MQTT is a featherweight, ISO complaint PUB-SUB messaging protocol.
- Designed for low powered devices
- PRAM consistent: Guaranteed in-order delivery per-publisher
- Multiple Transport: TCP, TLS, Websockets
- Flexible: Arbitrary message up to 256 MB
- Topics can also be used for Key-Value storage

## Topic based Pub/Sub

- Decouples Publisher and Subscribers

## Quality of Service

- QoS 0 - "Fire and Forget"
- Q0S 1 - "At least once"
- QoS 2 - "Exactly once; 2 phase commit"

Ideal for intermittent connectivity; Sessions may last weeks or months
Supports Disconnect & Last Will & Testament message

- MQTT supports Retained messages which are automatically delivered when a client subscribes to a topic.
