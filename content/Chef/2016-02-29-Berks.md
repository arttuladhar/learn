## Berkshelf

Reference External Dependent Cookbooks so that it can download those cookbooks rather than manually downloading via knife cookbook command.

` knife cookbook site`

Berkshelf lets you treat your cookbooks the way you treat gem in a Ruby project. When external cookbooks are used, Berkshelf doesn't requite `knife cookbook site` to install community cookbooks.

### Implementing Berkshelf
`gem install berkshelf`

### Install Cookbooks via Berks
`berks install`

### Upload berks to Chef Server
`berks upload <cookbook>`
