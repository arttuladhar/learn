## Networking Fundamentals

The Open Syste Interconnection (OSI) Model is a standard used by networking manufacturers globally. It was created and published in 1984; it splits all network communications into seven layers. Each layer servers the layer that's above it plus the layer beneath it which adds additional capabilities. Data between two devices travels down the stack on the device's A-side (wrapped at each layer) and gets transmitted before moving up the stack at the device B-side (where the wrapping gets stripped aways at every stage). The data wrapping process is called encapsulation.
