You also get some options that are not available, with HTTP(S) load balancing. For example, you can load balance additional TCP/UDP-based protocols such as SMTP traffic.

But that’s all it does.\nIt’s actually react-redux that lets you connect pieces of the state to React components.\n The state is the data, and the store is where it’s kept\n Redux Store Redux Reducer Reducer\u0026rsquo;s job is to take the current state and action and return the new state. It has another job, too. It should return the initial state the first time it\u0026rsquo;s called.\nReducer Rule # 1 = Never return undefined from a reducer Reduce Rule # 2 = Reduces must be a pure functions (They can\u0026rsquo;t modify their arguments, and they can\u0026rsquo;t have side effects)\nRedux Actions An action is Redux-speak for a plain object with a property called type. In order to keep things sane and maintainable, we Redux users usually give our actions types that are plain strings, and often uppercased, to signify that they’re meant to be constant values.\nAn action object describes a change you want to make (like “please increment the counter”) or an event that happenend (like “the request to the server failed with this error”).\nIn order to make an action DO something, you need to dispatch it.\nRedux Dispatch The store we created earlier has a built-in function called dispatch. Call it with an action, and Redux will call your reducer with that action (and then replace the state with whatever your reducer returned).\nReferences "

	"content": " Projects Projects are the outermost container and are used to group resources that share the same trust boundary. Many developers map Projects to teams since each Project has its own access policy (IAM) and member list. Projects also serve as a collector of billing and quota details reflecting resource consumption. Projects contain Networks which contain Subnetworks, Firewall rules, and Routes (see below architecture diagrams for illustration).\nNetworks Networks directly connect your resources to each other and to the outside world. Networks, using Firewalls, also house the access policies for incoming and outgoing connections. Networks can be Global (offering horizontal scalability across multiple Regions) or Regional (offering low-latency within a single Region).\nSubnetworks Subnetworks allow you to group related resources (Compute Engine instances) into RFC1918 private address spaces. Subnetworks can only be Regional. A subnetwork can be in auto mode or custom mode.\nAn auto mode network has one subnet per region, each with a predetermined IP range and gateway. These subnets are created automatically when you create the auto mode network, and each subnet has the same name as the overall network.\nA custom mode network has no subnets at creation. In order to create an instance in a custom mode network, you must first create a subnetwork in that region and specify its IP range. A custom mode network can have zero, one, or many subnets per region.\nCreate Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network and Instances # Creating VPC Network with auto subnet gcloud compute networks create mynetwork --subnet-mode=auto # Creating VPC Network with Custom Subnet gcloud compute networks create privatenet --subnet-mode=custom # Creating Custom Subnet - privatesubnet gcloud compute networks subnets create privatesubnet --network=privatenet \\ --region=us-central1 --range=10.0.0.0/24 --enable-private-ip-google-access  gcloud compute instances create default-us-vm --zone=us-central1-a --network=default gcloud compute instances create mynet-us-vm --zone=us-central1-a --network=mynetwork gcloud compute instances create mynet-eu-vm --zone=europe-west1-b --network=mynetwork gcloud compute instances create privatenet-bastion --zone=us-central1-c \\ --subnet=privatesubnet --can-ip-forward gcloud compute instances create privatenet-us-vm --zone=us-central1-f \\ --subnet=privatesubnet  When any Project is created, a single Network named default is created for you. The default Network has the following 2 firewall rules defined for network traffic:\n default-deny-all-ingress - Deny all incoming traffic\ndefault-allow-all-egress - Allow all outbound traffic\nFirewall Rules The privilege of creating, modifying, and deleting firewall rules is reserved for the compute.securityAdmin role by IAM.\n gcloud beta compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-icmp --network mynetwork \\ --action ALLOW --direction INGRESS --rules icmp gcloud beta compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-ssh --network mynetwork \\ --action ALLOW --direction INGRESS --rules tcp:22 gcloud beta compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-internal --network \\ mynetwork --action ALLOW --direction INGRESS --rules all \\ --source-ranges 10.128.0.0/9 gcloud beta compute firewall-rules list \\ --filter=\u0026quot;network:mynetwork\u0026quot;  Cloud Routes If you want traffic from specific instances to specific ranges to be routed in a specific way, you can use Google Cloud Routes to set up the destination for this traffic.\nYou can route traffic based on instance tags and destination range, and you can set the next hop to either:\n A specific instance (by instance name or IP) A VPN Tunnel The default internet gateway  If multiple routes exist, the more specific route will be used. If there are multiple of those, the lowest priority value is used. Between Subnetworks, routes are automatically created implicitly at lowest priority value. Those routes cannot be changed or deleted.\nConvert to a NAT gateway # Tag Instance gcloud compute instances add-tags privatenet-us-vm --zone us-central1-f --tags nat-me # Create NAT Route gcloud compute routes create nat-route --network privatenet \\ --destination-range 0.0.0.0/0 --next-hop-instance privatenet-bastion \\ --next-hop-instance-zone us-central1-c --tags nat-me --priority 800  "
